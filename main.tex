    Neuroimaging studies, particularly those involving structural MRI analysis,
    have faced challenges in reproducibility due to software variability. This
    study investigates the impact of numerical instability in FreeSurfer 7.3.1
    on structural MRI measures and their relationships with clinical outcomes in
    Parkinson's disease (PD). Utilizing Monte Carlo Arithmetic (MCA), we
    evaluate the extent of numerical variability in FreeSurfer's estimation of
    brain structure metrics, including cortical thickness, surface area,
    cortical and subcortical volumes. Our findings suggest that numerical
    variability affects the precision of these metrics, with implications for
    both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Specifically, the
    variability influences the detection of group differences between PD
    patients and healthy controls, as well as correlations between MRI-derived
    measures and disease severity. These results highlight the need for greater
    caution in interpreting structural MRI metrics in clinical research and
    underscore the importance of addressing numerical variability to improve the
    reliability of neuroimaging outcomes in PD studies.

\section{Introduction}

Neuroscience relies heavily on computational methods to analyze neuroimaging
data. However, the reproducibility of such analyses has recently come under
scrutiny. Reproducibility in neuroimaging is characterized by two key aspects:
the ability to replicate findings using the same analyses, and the
generalizability of results obtained with different data and computational
approaches. A notable example of the reproducibility challenge was shown in the
study by Botvinik-Nezer et al~\cite{botvinik2020variability}, where 70
independent research teams analyzed the same fMRI dataset using different
pipelines, yet agreed on only 4 of 9 predefined hypotheses. The variability in
outcomes was largely attributed to differences in the data processing methods,
emphasizing the role of software variability in neuroimaging.

Beyond functional imaging, variability in structural MRI measurements has also
been well documented, especially regarding differences between software
versions. Gronenschild et al.~\cite{gronenschild2012effects} found that the
estimation of brain volume and cortical thickness varied significantly across
FreeSurfer versions, while Bhagwat et al.~\cite{bhagwat2021understanding}
reported low correlations in cortical thickness measurements between different
neuroimaging software packages. More recent studies have also highlighted the
effects of software version changes on measurement reliability. For instance,
Haddad et al.~\cite{haddad2023multisite} found significant differences in brain
structure estimation between different FreeSurfer versions, with varying
degrees of compatibility depending on the brain region being measured.

Despite the growing body of evidence on software-related variability, less
attention has been paid to within-version numerical variability. Numerical
variability refers to small changes in software output caused by factors such
as random initializations, parallel processing, or computational imprecision,
all of which can occur even when the same software version is used. This type
of variability could potentially have a significant impact on clinical
research, where neuroimaging data is often used to investigate relationships
between brain structure and disease progression. In the context of Parkinson's
disease (PD), MRI-derived metrics such as cortical thickness and subcortical
volume have been associated with disease severity and progression. However, the
reliability of these associations could be compromised by numerical
variability, as measurement differences may obscure subtle changes in brain
structure that are clinically relevant.

The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of numerical variability
within a single version of FreeSurfer (7.3.1) on the estimation of structural
MRI-derived measures and their associations with clinical outcomes in
Parkinson's disease. While prior research has focused on the differences
between software versions, this study seeks to quantify the extent to which
numerical variability within the same version affects these outcomes. We
focused on cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes, which are
commonly used in clinical neuroscience research. By comparing the results
across repeated runs of the same analysis pipeline, we aimed to assess the
stability of these metrics and evaluate how variability in these measurements
might influence the detection of group differences between PD patients and
healthy controls, as well as correlations between brain structure and clinical
measures such as UPDRS scores.

Our study addresses a gap in the literature by focusing on within-version
variability, as opposed to the more commonly studied between-version
variability. Previous studies have shown that software version changes can
impact the estimation of brain structure, but fewer studies have quantified the
variability that exists even when using a single version of the software. Given
that numerical variability could interfere with the ability to detect subtle
disease-related changes, it is critical to evaluate its potential effects on
both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in PD. Our findings will provide
important insights into the reliability of FreeSurfer's outputs in clinical
research and help inform future efforts to improve reproducibility in
neuroimaging studies.

\subsection{Motivation}

The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging, particularly within clinical
research, has drawn attention to the inherent variability in computational
methods used to analyze brain imaging data. This issue is especially pertinent
in Parkinson's disease (PD) research, where MRI-derived measures, such as
cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, have shown promising associations
with disease severity, progression, and the differentiation between various
syndromes. However, despite these associations, there are currently no
established MRI biomarkers widely accepted for PD diagnosis or monitoring
disease progression. One of the key reasons for this gap is the variability in
brain structure measurements across studies, which undermines the reliability
and generalizability of findings.

Measurement variability can stem from several factors, including differences
between software versions, variations in processing pipelines, and even
numerical variability within a single software version. While between-version
variability has been extensively studied, within-version numerical
variability—small differences in results generated from repeated runs of the
same analysis software—remains underexplored. This variability can be due to
subtle factors such as parallel processing, floating-point precision, and
random initializations, all of which may affect the reproducibility of
structural brain metrics, particularly in cross-sectional and longitudinal
studies of neurodegenerative diseases like PD.

Understanding the extent and impact of numerical variability is crucial for
several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enhancing the reliability of neuroimaging studies in PD research: If numerical
          variability is not accounted for, researchers may draw incorrect conclusions
          about the association between brain structure and disease severity, potentially
          leading to inconsistent findings across studies. By investigating numerical
          variability, we can better assess the stability of MRI-derived metrics and
          ensure that these measures are reliable across repeated analyses.

    \item Improving the potential of MRI as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for PD: As a
          non-invasive imaging method, MRI holds significant promise for diagnosing and
          monitoring Parkinson's disease, offering a way to track brain structure changes
          without the need for invasive procedures. One of the main barriers to realizing
          MRI's clinical utility lies in the variability of the measurements it produces.
          Subtle differences in brain structure, which could be key early indicators of
          PD or markers of disease progression, may be obscured by variability factors
          such as numerical variability. By quantifying and addressing this variability,
          we aim to improve the precision and consistency of MRI metrics, potentially
          paving the way for MRI to fulfill its role as an effective tool in clinical
          practice.

    \item Advancing our understanding of the relationship between brain structure and PD
          clinical outcomes: A clearer understanding of the relationship between
          MRI-derived structural measures and clinical outcomes, such as the Unified
          Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, is vital for improving PD
          management. However, this relationship can only be reliably studied if the
          structural measures themselves are stable and consistent across different
          analysis sessions. Investigating the impact of numerical variability will help
          clarify whether observed associations between brain structure and clinical
          outcomes are robust, or if they are partly artifacts of measurement
          inconsistency.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, the motivation for this study stems from the pressing need to
address numerical variability in MRI-derived measures, particularly in the
context of Parkinson's disease research. By doing so, we aim to enhance the
reliability of neuroimaging studies, improve the diagnostic and prognostic
potential of MRI for PD, and deepen our understanding of how brain structure
relates to clinical outcomes in this complex neurodegenerative disease.

\subsection{Objectives}

The overall objective is to investigate the impact of numerical variability in
FreeSurfer 7.3.1 on the clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease. Specifically,
this analysis aims to (1) investigate how numerical variability affects the
detection of group differences in subcortical volumes and cortical thickness
between healthy controls (HC) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients over time.
(2) Assess the extent to which numerical instability impacts observed
correlations between disease severity, as measured by clinical outcomes (e.g.,
UPDRS scores), and brain structure measures in PD patients, both at baseline
and longitudinally.

The study aims to provide valuable insights into the reliability of FreeSurfer
7.3.1 for Parkinson's disease research. Furthermore, it seeks to offer
recommendations on how to mitigate the effects of numerical variability in
clinical neuroimaging studies, ultimately enhancing the reproducibility and
accuracy of MRI-derived measures in PD research.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Numerical variability assessment}

Floating-point arithmetic, governed by the IEEE-754 standard, approximates real
numbers with finite precision, making rounding errors inevitable. These
rounding errors can accumulate, potentially rendering extensive scientific
computations imprecise or erroneous. Quantifying such numerical errors
accurately is challenging due to the vast number of calculations typically
involved. Stochastic arithmetic addresses this issue by treating the evaluation
of numerical errors as a statistical sampling problem.

Among stochastic arithmetic techniques, Monte Carlo Arithmetic
(MCA)~\cite{parker1997monte} leverages randomness to assess numerical
instability resulting from finite-precision calculations. MCA introduces
controlled random perturbations into basic arithmetic operations
$(+,-,\times,\div)$, simulating unbiased rounding independent of previous
operations. This approach enables systematic evaluations of how software or
hardware modifications impact computational stability and result reliability.
MCA incorporates the concept of virtual precision, which controls the amplitude
of injected noise. By executing the same computational task multiple times, MCA
allows measurement of result stability by estimating the number of significant
digits preserved across runs.

MCA has also been extended to elementary mathematical libraries, such as
\texttt{libm}, which includes functions like \texttt{exp}, \texttt{log},
\texttt{sin}, and \texttt{cos}. The Fuzzy-libm
project~\cite{salari2021accurate} provides a comprehensive ecosystem of Docker
images containing a version of \texttt{libm} compiled with
Verificarlo~\cite{denis2016verificarlo}, an LLVM-based compiler that replaces
traditional floating-point operations with their MCA counterparts. Fuzzy-libm
applies random perturbations to the output of \texttt{libm} functions,
effectively simulating variability across different software implementations.
This approach has proven effective for emulating the impact of operating system
changes on numerical computations~\cite{salari2021accurate}.

\subsection{Participants}

We selected participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative
(PPMI) cohort, a large-scale, multi-site study designed to identify biomarkers
of Parkinson's disease. The PPMI cohort includes individuals with early-stage
Parkinson's disease, healthy controls, and those with other parkinsonian
syndromes. The PPMI study aims to collect and analyze a wide range of clinical,
genetic, and imaging data to better understand the progression of Parkinson's
disease and identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.

We started with 210 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD)
participated in the study: 181 with PD without mild cognitive impairment
(PD-non-MCI) and 29 with PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 106
healthy controls (HC). We excluded PD-MCI patients from the analysis to avoid
confounding effects of mild cognitive impairment on clinical evaluations.
Additionally, we excluded participants with other neurological diagnoses to
ensure that the results reflected the effects of Parkinson's disease alone. The
inclusion criteria for PD patients comprised a primary diagnosis of PD, the
availability of two visits with a T1-weighted scan, and the absence of other
neurological diagnoses. PD patients were evaluated using the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores.



We ended with 125 PD-non-MCI patients and 106 HC were considered. 


The data
collection was sanctioned by the local ethics committees of PPMI's
participating institutions, and all participants provided written informed
consent. Descriptive statistics for each group can be found in
Table~\ref{tab:cohort_stat}. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki
and received an exemption from Concordia University's Research Ethics Unit.

In total, 210 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) participated in
the study: 181 with PD without mild cognitive impairment (PD-non-MCI) and 29
with PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Additionally, 106 healthy
controls (HC) were included. All participants were sourced from the Parkinson's
Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI; www.ppmi-info.org). The inclusion
criteria for PD patients comprised a primary diagnosis of PD, the availability
of a T1-weighted scan, and the absence of other neurological diagnoses. For the
clinical analysis, 125 PD-non-MCI patients and all 106 HC were considered.
Every participant in this subset had two study visits with T1-weighted images
available. Additionally, PD patients were evaluated using the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. PD-MCI patients were excluded
from the clinical analysis to prevent potential confounding effects of MCI on
clinical evaluations.

\subsection{Image acquisition and preprocessing}

T1-weighted MRI images were obtained from PPMI that uses standardized
acquisition parameters: repetition time = 2.3 s, echo time = 2.98 s, inversion
time = 0.9 s, slice thickness = 1 mm, number of slices = 192, field of view =
256 mm, and matrix size = 256 $\times$ 256. However, since PPMI is a multisite
project there may be slight differences in the sites' setup.

To assess numerical variability in FreeSurfer outputs, we used FreeSurfer
7.3.1, instrumented with Fuzzy-libm. The virtual precision was set to 53 for
binary64 (double precision) and 24 for binary32 (single precision) to simulate
machine-level precision errors. The \texttt{recon-all} function was employed
for cortical reconstruction, extracting volumes, cortical thickness, and
surface area for each participant. This process was repeated 34 times per
subject, generating 34 sets of brain structure metrics. Due to instabilities
introduced by MCA, some runs failed and were excluded from the analysis.

To ensure the quality of the segmentations, we manually inspected them along
the three anatomical axes. Segmentations with visible errors were excluded from
the analysis. Table~\ref{tab:qc-stats} summarizes the number of excluded
executions.

To standardize the dataset, we randomly selected 25 successful runs per
subject/visit pair, resulting in 25 sets of MCA repetitions, each containing
the same number of subject/visit pairs. Maintaining a consistent number of
subjects across repetitions was essential for statistical analysis.
Subject/visit pairs with fewer than 25 MCA repetitions were excluded to ensure
consistency in statistical analyses.

Once the perturbed datasets were obtained, downstream analysis was performed
using a FreeSurfer pipeline without Fuzzy-libm to prevent further
perturbations.

For each MCA repetition, we followed the longitudinal preprocessing stream to
analyze images~\cite{reuter2012within}. Initially, both time points were
processed cross-sectionally with the default pipeline, after which an unbiased
template from the two images was generated and processed longitudinally.
Specifically, an unbiased within-subject template space and
image~\cite{reuter2011avoiding} was created using robust, inverse-consistent
registration~\cite{reuter2010highly}.

\subsection{Numerical Variability Assessment}

We evaluated the numerical variability of FreeSurfer 7.3.1 in two contexts: (1)
cross-sectional analysis and (2) longitudinal analysis.

\subsubsection{Cross-sectional Analysis}

First, we measured the numerical variability in estimating brain volumes,
cortical thickness, and surface area using the PPMI cohort. For each subject,
cortical and subcortical volumes, as well as cortical surface areas and
thickness, were extracted from each T1w scan across the 26 MCA repetitions
using the Destrieux 2009 atlas in FreeSurfer. We calculated the number of
significant digits and the standard deviation of these measurements. The
\emph{Significant Digits} package (described in Section~\ref{sec:sig_digits})
was used to compute the number of significant digits, while the standard
deviation captured variability across repetitions.

We also compared the number of significant digits between HC and PD groups
using a paired t-test. To further investigate differences in software
variability between these groups, we conducted a two-sample t-test.
Additionally, we calculated the Sørensen-Dice coefficient to assess structural
overlap across MCA repetitions. The extended Sørensen-Dice coefficient was
applied for each ROI and structural measure using the following formula:
\[
    \text{Dice}(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n) = \frac{n \left| \overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\bigcap}} A_i \right|}{\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}} \left| A_i \right|}.
\]

\subsubsection{Longitudinal Analysis}

Second, we analyzed volume, cortical thickness, and surface area across two
time points in the longitudinal cohort. At the subcortical level, we examined
correlations between baseline subcortical volumes and UPDRS scores, as well as
potential group differences in subcortical volumes between PD-non-MCI and HC
groups. We also conducted longitudinal analyses to assess the correlation
between the rate of change in UPDRS scores and subcortical volumes, as well as
group differences in subcortical volume change rates. The rate of subcortical
volume change was calculated as $((\text{volume}_2 - \text{volume}_1) /
    \text{volume}_1) \times 100$. Partial correlation analysis was used for
correlation assessments, while ANCOVA was applied for group comparisons. All
analyses were adjusted for age and sex, with additional adjustments for the
time interval between visits in longitudinal analyses.

At the cortical vertex level, we explored correlations between baseline
cortical thickness and UPDRS scores, along with group differences in baseline
cortical thickness. Vertex-wise longitudinal analyses were performed to assess
correlations between changes in UPDRS scores and the rate of change in cortical
thickness, as well as group differences in cortical thickness change rates. The
rate of cortical thickness change was calculated as $(\text{thickness}_2 -
    \text{thickness}_1) / (\text{time}_2 - \text{time}_1)$, expressed in mm/year.
Age and sex were included as covariates, and longitudinal analyses were further
adjusted for the time between visits. A cluster-wise permutation-based
$p$-value threshold of 0.05 was applied, and the frequency of identified
clusters across the 26 MCA repetitions was reported.

\section{Results}

The PD patients and HC group did not differ significantly in age ($p > 0.05$).
However, significant differences were found in years of education ($t = -2.05$,
$p = 0.04$) and sex distribution ($\chi^2 = 4.15$, $p = 0.04$). In the clinical
cohort, no significant differences were observed between PD-non-MCI patients
and the HC group in terms of age, education, time interval between visits, or
sex distribution ($p > 0.05$). The descriptive statistics are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:cohort_stat}.

\subsection{Cross-sectional Analysis}

We evaluated the numerical variability of FreeSurfer 7.3.1 in estimating brain
structure metrics such as cortical thickness, surface area, and both cortical
and subcortical volumes. Figure~\ref{fig:sig_digits_cortical} illustrates the
number of significant digits for each cortical region and metric.
Table~\ref{tab:sig-cortical} provides the average number of significant digits
across all subjects and regions. Figure~\ref{fig:dice} presents the Dice
coefficient for each ROI and structural measure, while
Figure~\ref{fig:sig_digits_subcortical} shows the number of significant digits
for subcortical volume in each region and group.

Our results indicate that the measurements produced by FreeSurfer 7.3.1 exhibit
numerical instability, with an average of $1.49 \pm 0.27$ significant digits
for cortical thickness, $1.03 \pm 0.27$ for surface area, and $1.00 \pm 0.28$
for volume. This suggests that, on average, the measurements are precise to
only one decimal place. The number of significant digits is consistent across
regions, with an average range of $[\min, \max]$ significant digits between
$[1.05, 1.75]$ for cortical thickness, $[0.58, 1.35]$ for surface area, and
$[0.52, 1.36]$ for cortical volume. Notably, the variability between subjects
is high for all three metrics, with some measurements showing as few as zero
significant digits, indicating a complete loss of precision in certain cases.

Figure~\ref{fig:dice} highlights substantial discrepancies between subjects.
Visually, the distribution of the Dice coefficient appears similar across
regions, although certain regions, particularly the vessels, show the highest
variability.

\subsection{Longitudinal Analysis}

\subsubsection{Subcortical volume analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The partial correlation between the UPDRS-III scores and the subcortical volume
          at baseline.
    \item The partial correlation between the rate of change in UPDRS-III scores and the
          rate of change in subcortical volume longitudinally.
    \item The group differences in the baseline subcortical volume between PD patients
          and healthy controls.
    \item The group differences in the rate of change in subcortical volume
          longitudinally between PD patients and healthy controls.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:significance_correlation} displays the proportion of
statistically significant tests ($p < 0.05$) across the 26 MCA repetitions for
each brain region. These tests were uncorrected for multiple comparisons. The
resulting ratios fluctuate between 0 and 1, but are not uniformly distributed.
This variability reflects uncertainty in the statistical significance of the
results, attributable to numerical instability. This ratio can be interpreted
as an indicator of confidence or consensus across repetitions: values near 0.5
indicate maximal uncertainty—where entropy is highest—while values approaching
0 or 1 suggest higher apparent consistency. However, these values alone are not
sufficient to infer statistical or clinical significance; further analyses
would be required to support any such conclusions. The purpose here is to
highlight the uncertainty introduced by numerical variability in statistical
computations.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{figures/significance_correlation.pdf}
    \caption{Ratio of statistical tests that were significant
        ($p<0.05$) among the 26 MCA repetitions for each regions.\label{fig:significance_correlation}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:statstest_coefficients_distribution} presents the distributions
of partial correlation coefficients (r-values) and F-statistics from ANCOVA,
across MCA repetitions, for both baseline and longitudinal analyses. Yellow
dots represent individual results from MCA repetitions; grey violins depict the
estimated distributions; red diamonds indicate the results obtained from a
standard FreeSurfer execution using IEEE arithmetic (i.e., without MCA-induced
variability). For partial correlations (top row), the distance between the
center of the distribution and zero correlates with the proportion of
significant results shown in Figure 1. For example, the Right Caudate and Right
Putamen regions in the longitudinal analysis show distributions centered near
zero, corresponding to a significance ratio close to 0.5. For group comparisons
(bottom row), regions with distributions closed to zero correlates with ratio
equal or close to zero. For instance, the Left-Caudate and Right-Caudate at
baseline or the Right-Accumbens-area for longitudinal analysis. A more
comprehensive understanding of how distribution characteristics relate to
significance ratios would require additional in-depth analysis.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Vertex-wise analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The correlation between the UPDRS-III scores and the cortical thickness at
          baseline.
    \item The correlation between the rate of change in UPDRS-III scores and the rate of
          change in cortical thickness longitudinally.
    \item The group differences in the baseline cortical thickness between PD patients
          and healthy controls.
    \item The group differences in the rate of change in cortical thickness
          longitudinally between PD patients and healthy controls.
\end{enumerate}

To assess statistical significance, we employed permutation tests. Permutation
test provides a non-parametric test to evaluate whether a given measure
significantly deviates from the population. Variability introduced by MCA
reveals the numerical instability of FreeSurfer 7.3.1 shows that the
significance of cortical regions fluctuated across repetitions.

Specifically, only two regions were found to be statistically significant in
two repetitions out of 26, suggesting a lack of statistical power. The surface
sizes of significant regions varied considerably, with examples such as
$1005.95 \pm 39.34 mm^2$ and $996.83 \pm 42.91 mm^2$.

\paragraph{Group Analysis}

No clusters were found to be statistically significant using the permutation
test (1000 permutations).

\paragraph{Correlation Analysis}

The following regions were identified using a permutation test (1000
permutations) for the correlation analysis. Each region was significant in only
one MCA repetition, further demonstrating a lack of replicability.

\section{Discussion}

The observed numerical variability in key metrics --- cortical thickness,
surface area, and volume --- raises concerns about the reliability of these
measurements in clinical research. The low precision in these metrics could
impede the detection of meaningful effects, particularly in studies of diseases
like Parkinson's. At baseline, we found no statistically significant
differences between the HC and PD groups across all regions and metrics. This
lack of differentiation suggests that these metrics may not be sensitive enough
to detect early-stage or subtle effects of Parkinson's disease. The clusters
identified in the analysis were inconsistent across repetitions, with only 1
out of 26 clusters appearing consistently. This highlights the challenge of
reproducing significant findings, likely due to variability in the
data.Inconsistencies were also observed across different methodologies,
specifically when comparing results from a Z-test and a permutation test. This
suggests that methodological choices can significantly impact outcomes and
interpretations.

It is possible that higher-resolution data could have revealed more significant
findings, as the current resolution may be insufficient to capture subtle
structural changes. Additionally, the metrics used—cortical thickness, surface
area, and volume—may lack the sensitivity required to detect subtle
neuroanatomical differences associated with Parkinson's disease. The effects of
Parkinson's disease itself may be too subtle to be detected by current
methodologies, further compounded by the numerical variability inherent in the
data.

While numerical variability appears to have a more substantial impact on the
results than software-related variability (as reported by Sokolowski et al.,
2024), our longitudinal analysis shows limited significance. Fewer clusters
were identified using the permutation test compared to the Z-test, and the
clusters identified by the Z-test were not consistent across repetitions.

The higher variability observed between subjects, compared to within-subject
variability, is a positive sign for the reproducibility of results. Despite
numerical variability, this suggests that the software remains reliable when
applied across different subjects, supporting its use in future studies.

\section{Conclusions}

Our analysis of cross-sectional data reveals several key insights into the
reliability of FreeSurfer's brain structure metrics. Across all subjects and
regions, the measurements for cortical thickness, surface area, and cortical
volume demonstrated a low average number of significant digits. This indicates
a limited precision in these metrics, which could affect the reliability of the
results in clinical research, particularly when detecting small,
disease-related changes in brain structure. Additionally, the Dice coefficients
for both cortical and subcortical volumes were found to be low, indicating poor
overlap between repeated measures. This variability undermines the utility of
volume estimates for robust comparisons in either longitudinal or
cross-sectional studies.

Furthermore, there was substantial variability in the number of significant
digits between subjects, suggesting that the numerical stability of these
measurements varies markedly between individuals. This variability complicates
comparisons across subjects and raises concerns about the generalizability of
the results. However, one positive finding was that the variability between
subjects was greater than the variability within subjects. This is an
encouraging sign for reproducibility, as it suggests that FreeSurfer performs
consistently when applied to the same subject over time, which enhances
confidence in its ability to track longitudinal changes within individuals.

In the longitudinal analysis, additional challenges emerged in tracking changes
over time in brain metrics, particularly in relation to clinical outcomes such
as the UPDRS scores. We found no significant vertex-wise correlations between
baseline UPDRS scores, which assess Parkinson's disease severity, and cortical
thickness. This lack of correlation implies that cortical thickness may not be
a sensitive biomarker for disease severity at the individual level,
particularly in the early stages of Parkinson's. Similarly, no significant
vertex-wise correlations were observed between the rate of change in UPDRS
scores and the rate of change in cortical thickness, suggesting that the
progression of Parkinson's, as measured by UPDRS scores, may not be closely
linked to changes in cortical thickness, at least with the metrics and
resolution employed in this study.

Another notable limitation was the inconsistency in cluster detection across
repetitions. Only one out of 26 clusters was reproduced consistently,
highlighting the challenge of obtaining reliable results using cluster-based
statistical methods. The variability in the data appears to have a strong
influence on cluster identification, further emphasizing the need for
methodological refinements. Moreover, no statistically significant group
differences in cortical thickness were found at baseline between Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients and healthy controls (HC), indicating that cortical
thickness alone may not be a sufficient marker for distinguishing between these
groups at early stages of the disease. Likewise, there were no significant
differences in the rate of cortical thickness change between the two groups
over time, suggesting that the progression of cortical thinning may be too
subtle or inconsistent to detect with the current methodologies, or that the
metrics used lack sensitivity to capture meaningful longitudinal changes
associated with Parkinson's disease.

In summary, these findings underscore the limitations of FreeSurfer 7.3.1 in
providing precise and reliable brain structure measurements for both
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, especially in the context of
Parkinson's disease research. The observed low numerical stability, high
between-subject variability, and the absence of significant group differences
or correlations with clinical measures raise concerns about the sensitivity and
robustness of these metrics for detecting subtle disease-related changes.
Future research should consider the use of higher-resolution data, larger
sample sizes, and alternative neuroimaging biomarkers to better capture subtle
structural changes in the brain. Additionally, methodological improvements are
needed to reduce numerical variability and enhance the reproducibility of
results across different studies and subjects.

\section{Cross-sectional Analysis}

As a side result, the cross-sectional analysis measures the impact of numerical
variability in FreeSurfer version 7.3.1 on the PPMI (Parkinson's Progression
Markers Initiative) cohort. This will involve comparing the estimation of
structural MRI measures, including cortical and subcortical volumes, cortical
thickness, and surface area. The goal is to assess the stability of these key
metrics and determine how numerical variability may affect their reliability in
clinical research.

\section{Significant digits formula}

We compute the number of significant bits \(\hat{s}\) with probability
\(p_s=0.95\) and confidence \(1-\alpha_s=0.95\) using the \emph{Significant
    Digits}
package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/verificarlo/significantdigits}}
(version 0.2.0). \emph{Significant Digits} implements the Centered Normality
Hypothesis approach described in~\cite{sohier2021confidence}:
\[
    \hat{s_i} = -\log_2 \left| \frac{\hat{\sigma_i}}{\hat{\mu_i}} \right| -
    \delta(n, \alpha_s, p_s),
\]
where \(\hat{\sigma_i}\) and \(\hat{\mu_i}\) are the average and standard
deviation over the repetitions, and
\begin{equation}
    \delta(n, \alpha_s, p_s) = \log_2 \left(
    \sqrt{\frac{n-1}{\chi^2_{1-\alpha_s/2}}} \Phi^{-1} \left( \frac{p_s+1}{2}
    \right) \right)
\end{equation}
is a penalty term for estimating \(\hat{s_i}\) with probability \(p_s\) and
confidence level \(1-\alpha_s\) for a sample size \(n\). \(\Phi^{-1}\) is the
inverse cumulative distribution of the standard normal distribution and
\(\chi^2\) is the Chi-2 distribution with \(n\)-1 degrees of freedom.
