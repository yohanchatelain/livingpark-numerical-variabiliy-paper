\section{Introduction}

FreeSurfer is a widely used, publicly available software for analyzing and
visualizing structural neuroimaging data. Version 7.3.1 represents one of the
latest major releases, offering advanced capabilities for estimating various
brain structure metrics such as gray matter volume, cortical thickness, and
surface area.

Recent studies have highlighted significant variability in neuroimaging results
due to differences in software and processing pipelines. For instance,
Botvinik-Nezer et al. (2020) demonstrated low agreement levels (21\% to 37\%)
among research teams analyzing the same fMRI data with different pipelines.
This variability extends to structural MRI measures, with studies showing
significant differences in brain volume and cortical thickness estimations
between software versions and toolboxes.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting
millions worldwide. Its prevalence and the potential of neuroimaging as a
diagnostic and prognostic tool make it a critical area for investigating the
impact of numerical variability in brain structure analysis.

\subsection{Motivation}

The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging, particularly in the context of
clinical research, underscores the importance of studying numerical
variability. In Parkinson's disease research, MRI-derived measures have shown
associations with disease severity, progression, and differentiation between
various syndromes. However, the lack of established MRI measures for PD
diagnosis or tracking may partly stem from measurement variability across
studies. Understanding the extent and impact of this variability is crucial
for:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Enhancing the reliability of neuroimaging studies in PD research.
    \item  Improving the potential of MRI as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for PD.
    \item  Advancing our understanding of the relationship between brain structure and PD
          clinical outcomes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Objectives}

\emph{Cross-sectional Analysis}: To measure the impact of the  numerical
variability of FreeSurfer 7.3.1 on the PPMI cohort. This involves comparing the
estimation of structural MRI measures such as cortical and subcortical volumes,
cortical thicknesses, and surface areas.

\emph{Longitudinal Analysis}: To evaluate the impact of numerical variability
on clinical research outcomes in the PD group. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigating how numerical variability affects the detection of group
          differences between HC and PD in subcortical volumes and cortical thickness
          over time.
    \item Assessing the influence of numerical instability on the observed correlations
          between disease severity and brain structure measures in PD patients, both at
          baseline and longitudinally.
\end{itemize}

By addressing these objectives, we aim to provide insights into the reliability
of FreeSurfer 7.3.1 in PD research and offer recommendations for mitigating the
effects of numerical variability in clinical neuroimaging studies.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Numerical variability assessment}

The floating-point arithmetic, ruled by the IEEE-754 norm, approximates real
numbers using finite precision in modern computers. Given a limited precision,
rounding off are inevitable, which can lead to cumulative errors, rendering
some calculations imprecise or incorrect. The challenge of accurately
quantifying the error in extensive scientific computations arises from the
large number of calculations involved. Stochastic arithmetic, with its reliance
on randomness, simplifies this challenge by converting it into a matter of
statistical sampling.

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Arithmetic}
\label{sec:mca}

Among the existing stochastic arithmetic techniques, Monte Carlo
Arithmetic~\cite{parker1997monte} (MCA) extends floating-point arithmetic by
exploiting randomness to assess numerical instability that arises from finite
precision calculations. MCA introduces random noise into basic arithmetic
operations $(+,-,\times,\div)$ to emulate unbiased, random rounding that is
independent of prior operations. Consequently, MCA facilitates assessments of
changes in softwares or hardwares, enabling the evaluation of their impact on
the significance of results. MCA offers a control over the magnitude of the
noised injected into the calculations with the concept of virtual precision. By
running the same code multiple times, the stability of outcomes can be measured
by calculating the number of significant digits in the outputs.

\subsubsection{Significant digits formula}
\label{sec:sig_digits}

We compute the number of significant bits \(\hat{s}\) with probability
\(p_s=0.95\) and confidence \(1-\alpha_s=0.95\) using the \emph{Significant
    Digits}
package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/verificarlo/significantdigits}}
(version 0.2.0). \emph{Significant Digits} implements the Centered Normality
Hypothesis approach described in~\cite{sohier2021confidence}:
\[
    \hat{s_i} = -\log_2 \left| \frac{\hat{\sigma_i}}{\hat{\mu_i}} \right| -
    \delta(n, \alpha_s, p_s),
\]
where \(\hat{\sigma_i}\) and \(\hat{\mu_i}\) are the average and standard
deviation over the repetitions, and
\begin{equation}
    \delta(n, \alpha_s, p_s) = \log_2 \left(
    \sqrt{\frac{n-1}{\chi^2_{1-\alpha_s/2}}} \Phi^{-1} \left( \frac{p_s+1}{2}
    \right) \right)
\end{equation}
is a penalty term for estimating \(\hat{s_i}\) with probability \(p_s\) and
confidence level \(1-\alpha_s\) for a sample size \(n\). \(\Phi^{-1}\) is the
inverse cumulative distribution of the standard normal distribution and
\(\chi^2\) is the Chi-2 distribution with \(n\)-1 degrees of freedom.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy-libm}
\label{sec:fuzzy-libm}

MCA has been extended to several libraries including the \texttt{libm} which
comprises elementary mathematical functions \texttt{(exp, log, cos, sin, ...)}.
The Fuzzy-libm~\cite{salari2021accurate} project presents an ecosystem of
Docker images, offering a \texttt{libm} that is recompiled with
Verificarlo~\cite{denis2015verificarlo}. This LLVM-based compiler replaces
floating-point arithmetic instructions for their MCA equivalents. The
Fuzzy-libm applies a random perturbation on the results of \texttt{libm}'
functions to simulate different implementations. It has been demonstrated to be
a good proxy to simulate OS changes~\cite{salari2021accurate}.

\subsection{Participants}d

In total, 210 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) participated in
the study: 181 with PD without mild cognitive impairment (PD-non-MCI) and 29
with PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Additionally, 106 healthy
controls (HC) were included. All participants were sourced from the Parkinson’s
Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI; www.ppmi-info.org). The inclusion
criteria for PD patients comprised a primary diagnosis of PD, the availability
of a T1-weighted scan, and the absence of other neurological diagnoses. For the
clinical analysis, 125 PD-non-MCI patients and all 106 HC were considered.
Every participant in this subset had two study visits with T1-weighted images
available. Additionally, PD patients were evaluated using the Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. PD-MCI patients were excluded
from the clinical analysis to prevent potential confounding effects of MCI on
clinical evaluations. The data collection was sanctioned by the local ethics
committees of PPMI's participating institutions, and all participants provided
written informed consent. Descriptive statistics for each group can be found in
Table~\ref{tab:cohort_stat}. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki
and received an exemption from Concordia University’s Research Ethics Unit.

\subsection{Image acquisition}

T1-weighted MRI images were obtained from PPMI that uses standardized
acquisition parameters: repetition time = 2.3 s, echo time = 2.98 s, inversion
time = 0.9 s, slice thickness = 1 mm, number of slices = 192, field of view =
256 mm, and matrix size = 256 $\times$ 256. However, since PPMI is a multisite
project there may be slight differences in the sites’ setup.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

To assess numerical variability in FreeSurfer outputs, we utilized FreeSurfer
7.3.1, instrumented with Fuzzy-libm. The virtual precision was set to 53 for
binary64 (double precision) and 24 for binary32 (single precision) to simulate
error-machine precision. The \texttt{recon-all} function was used for cortical
reconstruction, extracting volumes, cortical thickness, and surface area for
each participant. This process was repeated 34 times per subject, generating 34
sets of brain structure metrics. Due to the inherent instability of MCA, some
runs failed and were excluded from the analysis. To standardize the dataset, we
randomly selected 26 successful runs per subject, resulting in 26 sets of MCA
repetitions, each containing the same number of subjects. Ensuring consistency
in the number of subjects across repetitions is essential for statistical
analysis. Once the perturbed datasets were obtained, downstream analysis was
performed using a FreeSurfer pipeline without Fuzzy-libm to prevent further
perturbations.

For each MCA repetition, we followed the longitudinal preprocessing stream to
analyze images~\cite{reuter2012within}. Initially, both time points were
processed cross-sectionally with the default pipeline, after which an unbiased
template from the two images was generated and processed longitudinally.
Specifically, an unbiased within-subject template space and
image~\cite{reuter2011avoiding} was created using robust, inverse-consistent
registration~\cite{reuter2010highly}.

The analyses were conducted on the Virtual Imaging
Platform~\cite{glatard2012virtual}, which utilizes resources provided by the
Biomed virtual organization within the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI). We
extend our gratitude to Sorina Pop from CREATIS, Lyon, France, for her support.
All preprocessed images were visually inspected for quality.
