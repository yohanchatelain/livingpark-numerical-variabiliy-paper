# Nature Guidelines

## Submission Format
The Nature journals are flexible with regard to the format of initial submissions. Within reason, style and length will not influence consideration of a manuscript. If revisions are requested, the editor will provide detailed formatting instructions at that time. For information on length and formatting consult Nature Communications' content types.
Structured as follow:
- Introduction
- Results (divided by topical subheadings)
- Discussion (succint and no subheadings)
- Methods (divided by topical subheadings, <3000 words)
- Up to 10 figures


## Title
If possible, this should be 15 words or fewer and should not contain technical terms, abbreviations, punctuation and active verbs.

## Authors
Corresponding author(s) should be identified with an asterisk.

## Abstract
Provide a general introduction to the topic and a brief non-technical summary of your main results and their implication. (max 200 words)

## Text Length and Formatting
Attention to the following details can help expedite publication if we invite a revision after external review.

- **Articles**: an abstract of approximately 150 words, unreferenced; main text of no more than 5,000 words and 10 display items (figures, tables). As a guideline, Articles allow up to 70 references. Section headings should be used and subheadings should appear in 'Results' and 'Methods'.

## Methods
The Methods section appears in all online original research articles and should contain all elements necessary for interpretation and replication of the results. Methods should be written as concisely as possible and typically do not exceed 3,000 words but may be longer if necessary. We encourage you to deposit any step-by-step protocols used in your study in Protocol Exchange, an open resource maintained by NPG. These protocols are linked to the Methods section upon publication.

## References
These may only contain citations and should list only one publication with each number. Include the title of the cited article or dataset.

## Acknowledgements (optional)
Keep acknowledgements brief and do not include thanks to anonymous referees or editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

## Author Contributions
You must include a statement that specifies the individual contributions of each co-author. For example: "A.P.M. 'contributed' Y and Z; B.T.R. 'contributed' Y," etc. See our authorship policies for more details.

## Competing Interests
Submission of a competing interests statement is required for all content of the journal.

## Materials & Correspondence
Indicate the author(s) to whom correspondence and material requests should be addressed.

## Tables
Each table should be prepared using the Table menu in Word or the table environment in TeX/LaTeX and accompanied by a short title sentence describing what the table shows. Further details can be included as footnotes to the table.

## Figures
High-resolution image files are not required at initial submission, but please ensure that images are of sufficient resolution for referees to properly assess the data.

Should your manuscript be accepted, you will receive more extensive instructions for final submission of display items. However, some guidelines for final figure preparation are included below and here if you wish to minimize later revisions and possible delays.

- Provide images in RGB color and at 300 dpi or higher resolution.
- Use the same typeface (Arial or Helvetica) for all figures. Use symbol font for Greek letters.
- Use distinct colors with comparable visibility and avoid the use of red and green for contrast. Recoloring primary data, such as fluorescence images, to color-safe combinations such as green and magenta or other accessible color palettes is strongly encouraged. Use of the rainbow color scale should be avoided.
- Figures are best prepared at the size you would expect them to appear in print. At this size, the optimum font size is between 5pt and 8pt.
- We prefer vector files with editable layers. Acceptable formats are: .ai, .eps, .pdf, .ps and .svg for fully editable vector-based art; layered .psd and .tif for editable layered art; .psd, .tif, .png and .jpg for bitmap images; .ppt if fully editable and without styling effects; ChemDraw (.cdx) for chemical structures.
- Please use the Nature Research Chemical Structures Guide and ChemDraw template for formatting of chemical structures.

### Figure Legends
Figure legends should be <350 words each. They should begin with a brief title sentence for the whole figure and continue with a short statement of what is depicted in the figure, not the results (or data) of the experiment or the methods used. Legends should be detailed enough so that each figure and caption can, as far as possible, be understood in isolation from the main text.

## Statistical Information
Comprehensive information on the statistical analyses used must be included in the paper. The Methods must include a statistics section where you describe the statistical tests used and whether they were one- or two-tailed. Please ensure that the error bars are defined throughout the figures. For all statistics (including error bars), provide the EXACT n values used to calculate the statistics (reporting individual values rather than a range if n varied among experiments). For representative results, report the number of times that the measurements were repeated. Where relevant, provide exact values for both significant and non-significant P values. For ANOVAs, provide F values and degrees of freedom. For t-tests, provide t-values and degrees of freedom. Please specifically define the replicates.

## Supplementary Information
Please submit supplementary figures, small tables and text as a single combined PDF document. Tables longer than one page should be provided as an Excel or similar file type. For optimal quality video files please use H.264 encoding, the standard aspect ratio of 16:9 (4:3 is second best) and do not compress the video. We encourage submission of step-by-step synthesis procedures for chemical compounds and data on compound characterization. Supplementary information is not copy-edited, so please ensure that it is clearly and succinctly presented, and that the style and terminology conform to the rest of the manuscript.

## Data Availability
Please provide a data availability statement as a separate section after the Methods section but before the References, under the heading "Data Availability"; detailed guidance can be found in our data availability and data citations policy. Certain data types must be deposited in an appropriate public structured data depository (details are available here) and the accession number(s) provided in the manuscript. Full access is required at publication. Should full access to data be required for peer review, authors must provide it.

We encourage provision of other source data in unstructured public depositories such as Dryad or figshare, or as supplementary information. To maximize data reuse, we encourage publication of detailed descriptions of datasets in Scientific Data.

## Computer Code
Any previously unreported custom computer code used to generate results reported in the manuscript that are central to the main claims must be made available to editors and reviewers upon request. Any practical issues preventing code sharing will be evaluated by the editors who reserve the right to decline the manuscript if important code is unavailable. At publication, Nature journals consider it best practice to release custom computer code in a way that allows readers to repeat the published results.

Authors of such research papers will also be asked to fill out a code and software submission checklist that will be made available to editors and reviewers during manuscript assessment. The aim is to make studies that use such code more reliable by ensuring that all relevant documentation is available and by facilitating testing of software by the reviewers. Further detailed guidance and required documentation at submission and acceptance of the manuscript can be found here.

For all studies using custom code that is deemed central to the conclusions, a statement must be included under the heading "Code availability", indicating whether and how the code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. Code availability statements should be provided as a separate section after the data availability statement but before the References.

## Preprint Servers
Nature Research journals support posting of primary research manuscripts on community preprint servers such as arXiv and bioRxiv. We do, however, ask you to respect our policies on posting, citation and licensing of preprints.
